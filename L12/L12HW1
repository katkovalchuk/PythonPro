The database scheme consists of four tables:
Product(maker, model, type)
PC(code, model, speed, ram, hd, cd, price)
Laptop(code, model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer(code, model, color, type, price)
The Product table contains data on the maker, model number, and type of product ('PC', 'Laptop', or 'Printer').
It is assumed that model numbers in the Product table are unique for all makers and product types.
Each personal computer in the PC table is unambiguously identified by a unique code, and is additionally
characterized by its model (foreign key referring to the Product table), processor speed (in MHz) – speed field,
RAM capacity (in Mb) - ram, hard disk drive capacity (in Gb) – hd, CD-ROM speed (e.g, '4x') - cd, and its price.
The Laptop table is similar to the PC table, except that instead of the CD-ROM speed, it contains the screen size
(in inches) – screen. For each printer model in the Printer table, its output type (‘y’ for color and ‘n’
for monochrome) – color field, printing technology ('Laser', 'Jet', or 'Matrix') – type, and price are specified.

# Task 2
# 1.
Find the model number, speed and hard drive capacity for all the PCs with prices below $500.
Result set: model, speed, hd.

SELECT model, speed, hd from PC
WHERE price < 500

# 2.
List all printer makers. Result set: maker.

SELECT DISTINCT maker FROM Product
WHERE type='Printer'

# 3.
Find the model number, RAM and screen size of the laptops with prices over $1000.

SELECT model, ram, screen FROM Laptop
WHERE price > 1000

# 4.
Find all records from the Printer table containing data about color printers.

SELECT * FROM Printer
WHERE color='y'

# 5.
Find the model number, speed and hard drive capacity of PCs cheaper than $600 having a 12x or a 24x CD drive.

SELECT model, speed, hd FROM PC
WHERE price < 600 AND (cd='12x' OR cd='24x')


# Task 3
# 1.
Add following model into the PC table:
code: 20
model: 2111
speed: 950
ram: 512
hd: 60
cd: 52x
price: 1100

INSERT INTO PC (code, model, speed, ram, hd, cd, price)
VALUES ('20', '2111', '950', '512', '60', '52x', '1100')

# 2.
Add to the Product table following products from maker Z:
printer model 4003, PC model 4001 and laptop model 4002

INSERT INTO Product (maker, model, type)
VALUES ('Z','4003','Printer'),
       ('Z','4001','PC'),
       ('Z','4002','Laptop');

# 3.
Add the model 4444 with code=22, speed=1200 and price=1350 into the PC table.
The absent features should be supplied with the default values for corresponding columns.

INSERT INTO PC (code, model, speed, price)
VALUES ('22', '4444', '1200', '1350')

# 4.
For each group of laptops with the identical model number, add following record into PC table:
code: minimal code among laptops in the group +20;
model: laptop's model number +1000;
speed: maximal speed among laptops in the group;
ram: maximal ram size among laptops in the group *2
hd: maximal hd capacity among laptops in the group *2;
cd: default value;
price: maximal price among laptops in the group divided by 1.5.
Remark. Consider model number as numeric.

INSERT INTO PC (code, model, speed, ram, hd, price)
SELECT MIN(code)+20, model+1000, MAX(speed), MAX(ram)*2,
       MAX(hd)*2, MAX(price)/1.5
FROM Laptop
GROUP BY model

# 5.
Delete from PC table the computers having minimal hdd size or minimal ram size.

DELETE FROM PC WHERE
pc.ram=(select MIN(ram) from pc) or
pc.hd=(select MIN(hd) from pc)
